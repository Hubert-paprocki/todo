## Usage

The `src` directory contains the main code for this application. You can start modifying and building your app by editing the files in this directory.

The entry point for the application is `src/index.js`, where the root component is rendered.

The `public` directory contains the public assets for your application, such as HTML and favicon files. You can customize the `public/index.html` file to include any additional scripts or stylesheets.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized and minified version of your app in the `build` directory.

You can then deploy the contents of the `build` directory to your web server or any static hosting platform.
